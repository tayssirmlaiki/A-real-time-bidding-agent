# Real-time bidding agent
1) The  small piece of code   of file "Actor-Bidding-Agent.scala"  defines two message types, one for commanding the Actor to greet the Bidding Agent and one that the Actor will use to confirm that it has done so. The Greet type contains not only the information of whom to greet, it also holds an ActorRef that the sender of the message supplies so that the HelloBiddingAgent Actor can send back the confirmation message.

2) The  small piece of code   of file "Akka-HTTP-server.scala"  defines web server that welcomes you when you try to access it. When you run it and hit curl http://localhost:8080 on your command line it will return â€œWelcome to messaging service.
Now that we have a working server.
