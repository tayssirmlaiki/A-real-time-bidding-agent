# Real-time bidding agent
1)The  small piece of code   of file "Actor-Bidding-Agent.scala"  defines two message types, one for commanding the Actor to greet the Bidding Agent and one that the Actor will use to confirm that it has done so. The Greet type contains not only the information of whom to greet, it also holds an ActorRef that the sender of the message supplies so that the HelloBiddingAgent Actor can send back the confirmation message.
